**Front-end Developer (React Native) - Technical Assignment** 

**Objective:**
The goal of this assignment is to evaluate your skills in React Native development, state management, API integration, and UI/UX implementation. This task is designed to reflect real-world scenarios that you may encounter while working with our team.

---

### **Assignment Overview**
You are tasked with building a simple React Native application for a ride-hailing service. The app should allow users to:
1. **Search for pickup and drop-off locations** using a search bar integrated with the Mapbox Search API.
2. **Request a ride** by selecting the pickup and drop-off points.
3. **View ride details** after booking, including assigned driver information, car details, and ride status.
4. **Monitor ride status updates** in real time.

You can use Expo to set up the project for easy testing.

### **Requirements:**
1. **Project Setup:**
   - Use React Native with Expo.
   - Use TypeScript.
   - Implement state management using React Query or Context API.

1. **Start Mock Server:**
   - Run command `npm run server` to start the mock API server.

1. **Search for Locations:**
   - Implement a search bar to allow users to find pickup and drop-off locations.
   - Use Mapbox Search API for location lookup.

1. **Requesting a Ride:**
   - Allow users to request a ride by selecting a pickup and drop-off location.
   - Send a request to the mock API to book a ride.
   - Display the estimated fare (randomized by the backend).

1. **Fetching and Displaying Ride Details:**
   - Fetch ride details from the mock API after booking.
   - Display the assigned driverâ€™s name, car details (model, make, plate, color, year), and ride status.
   - Poll the API for real-time ride status updates (e.g., "Driver Arrived", "Ongoing", "Completed").

1. **Real-Time Ride Status Updates:**
   - Continuously fetch ride details to update the UI as the ride progresses.
   - Ensure users see live updates for when the driver arrives, the ride starts, and when it is completed.

1. **Code Quality & Best Practices:**
   - Write clean, modular, and well-documented code.
   - Follow best practices for state management and API integration.
   - Include basic unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library or an alternative.

### **Bonus Points:**
- Implement navigation using Expo Router.
- Use animations for smooth UI transitions.
- Implement a map view showing the pickup and drop-off locations using a service like Google Maps or Mapbox.
- Change dropoff location with pin marker when ride is in progress

---

### **Submission Guidelines:**
- Upload your project to a GitHub repository and share the link.
- Provide a README file with instructions on how to run the project.
- If possible, deploy the app using Expo and share the Expo link.

We are looking for developers who write clean, maintainable code and follow best practices.
Good luck! ðŸš€
